# TEP-300 Backport and Fixes
Backport of Peltor TEP-300 for SPTarkov 4.0.3 with fixes.<br />
Included model has gray color and preserves all statistics of `Peltor ComTac II` headset from SPT.<br />
Weight has been adjusted to be more realistic, instead just copying 1:1 existing headset, like BSG did.

The earplugs are unlocked on Ragman LL2, no quests required.

## For ones wondering why it's 410g:
Total weight of TEP-300 with its case and batteries: 188g<br />
